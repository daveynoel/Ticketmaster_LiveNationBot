# TicketMaster/LiveNation Bot
I modified it for K fans.

**Important:** 
This bot is for educational and personal use.  
Under no circumstances do I recommend buying tickets with the purpose of selling for profit.  
The author of these scripts takes no responsibility for any misuse associated with them.

Note: This bot is designed to only work with Ticketmaster's new website. (i.e. url starts with 'www1.ticketmaster.')
It will attempt to add the default number of lowest price tickets to the cart. You can then finish the purchase as normal.
You can change the number of tickets by modifying the numberOfTickets variable in the script. (Instructions to follow)

If this Bot successfully secures you tickets please donate.  
Donations encourage me to maintain the code and ensure it keeps working for future use!

3) Navigate to a 'www1.ticketmaster.' ticket page shortly before the tickets are due to go on sale.
The bot will automatically refresh regularly if the tickets aren't yet on sale.

Tip: Test it out on a page were tickets are already on sale. <br>
Tip: Run multiple tabs (But be careful!!!, too many requests and you risk getting blocked by Ticketmaster)
